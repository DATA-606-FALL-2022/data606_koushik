_**PROJECT INTRODUCTION:**_
  Synthetic face generation, as the title implies, pertains to synthetic generated faces employing machine learning data models, that have a diverse range of practical applications in today's world. Large projects can now be accomplished using generative networks and high computational power and modern applications. This model is also used in our project to generate trained images for real-time applications. So, why do we require these synthetically generated face images? Simply put, more data will be generated for use in research and development tasks. Some of the applications include: creating gaming characters, Instagram influencers, government agencies privacy and security, airport security screenings, fake imposter detections, and so on. 



_**PROJECT OBJECTIVE:**_
The objective of this project is to create a data model which can synthesize images of faces which it has never seen. The technology behind this is GANs which is short for Generative Adversarial Networks. Many firms and R&Ds started working on GANs extensively in recent days. 


_**Why is it important:**_
It is very common in data science to encounter issues such as the dataset being insufficiently large or diverse, or the amount of data present for one label dominating the amount of data present for another. This was an issue we encountered while developing a face recognition model for an attendance system. In such cases, face synthesis can be used as a data augmentation technique to generate additional data. Microsoft built an entire dataset of synthetic faces. When different models were tested, their performance was far superior to models trained on normal datasets on test data. Microsoft claims this is due to the increased diversity in the dataset.

  
  
_**Data Collection:**_  
• We obtained the dataset from "http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html"
• It is called the celebA dataset and contains over 200,000 face images along with different tags.
• The data is from a trusted source which is Multimedia lab from The Chinese University of Hong Kong. The data contains faces with over 38 different attributes:-
